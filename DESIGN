Basic Architecture:

Game is a C++ singleton, exposed with utility methods to QML.
These methods can add Objects to the game state
Map,BuildOption,Unit,MovingUnit,Doodad and Waypoint are all QDeclarativeItems affecting gamestate
Player is a QObject, but it's also created/manipulated in QML.

Map ties all these together, a Map is loaded into the game state to start with. Its players and units
become the starting game state.

Call Game functions to further affect the game state.

The Game has an internal tick to manipulate the state of its controlled objects so as to advance the game.
